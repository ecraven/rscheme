Procedures are first-class in &rs;, and they are instances of
the abstract class {ClassName/<function>/.

{section id="u.multi"}Multiple values
{Para}
&rs; supports returning multiple values from a function in an
integrated fashion (integrated meaning that intercalling between
functions that return multiple values and those that don't
is permitted; multiple return values is simply a generalization
of &r4rs;'s single return value).
{Para}
Multiple values are returned using the {Phrase Role="var"}values{/Phrase} construct,
and caught using the {Phrase Role="var"}bind{/Phrase} construct.
{Para}
An expression in any context other than the initializer
position of a {Phrase Role="var"}bind{/Phrase} is said to be in {Quote/single-value-expecting position./
If more than one value is returned into a single-value-expecting
position, then the remaining values are discarded.
If no values are returned into a single-value-expecting position,
then &f; is used instead.
{Para}
({Quote/Context/ here is basically the {Emphasis/continuation/ of the
expression -- that is, what form will execute after the expression
executes.)
{Para}
