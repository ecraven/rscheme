{Para}
&rs; is an object-oriented, extended version of the Scheme dialect of
Lisp, principally a merger of concepts from the Scheme language
(see {CiteTitle PUBWORK="article"}Revised^4 Report on Scheme{/CiteTitle})
and the Dylan language (see {CiteTitle PUBWORK="book"}Dylan{/CiteTitle}).
{Para}
&rs; is freely redistributable, and offers 
reasonable performance
despite being quite portable.  Code written in
&rs; can be compiled to C, and
the C can then be compiled with a normal C compiler to generate machine code.
By default,
however, &rs; compiles to bytecodes which are interpreted by
a (runtime) virtual machine.  This ensures that compilation is fast and
keeps code size down.
{Para}
To the casual user, &rs; appears to be an interpreted language.  You
can type &rs; code at a read-eval-print loop, and it executes the
code and prints the result.  In reality, every expression you type to
the read-eval-print-loop is compiled and the resulting code is executed.
Since &rs; compiles to bytecodes at runtime, the interaction
is fast.

{Sect1}{Title}Meta comments{/Title}
{Para}
This book is currently serving multiple purposes, some of which conflict.
It's {Emphasis/primary/ goal is to serve as a specification or target for the
{UserInput/0.9/ release of &rs;.  However, because of the high amount of overlap
in much of the system, it is also being used as documentation for the
current ({UserInput/0.7.1/) release, since there is no other serious documentation
extant.
{Para}
The intention is that by the time {UserInput/0.9/ is implemented, this
document will be substantially complete and serve as a user guide and
technical reference for &rs;.  Also at that point, it will no longer
need to nor serve as a description of the {UserInput/0.7/ or {UserInput/0.8/
release.

{Title}Overview{/Title}
{Para}
This book is 
organized
as reference material.  No special effort is made to guide the
user through programming in &rs;.  For this purpose, we
highly recommend 
Paul Wilson's {CiteTitle PUBWORK="book"}Introduction to Scheme{/CiteTitle}.
{Para}
This book
is intended as a general purpose user 
guide{footnote}{para}For a technical reference, 
see the companion technical volume,
The Design and Implementation of &rs;.{/footnote}.
The target audience for this part is experienced programmers
who wish to use &rs; as a language and system for fairly
normal programming tasks.  Included in this book are chapters
describing the standard &rs; extensions -- {FirstTerm Role="defn"}packages{/FirstTerm}
that ship with the distribution.

{Title}Conventions{/Title}
{Para}
In this book, we adopt certain usual typographical and
stylistic conventions.  These are designed to help the reader
understand the meaning of a sequence of characters.
{Para}
Content that is displayed like {UserInput}this{/UserInput} is
text that is likely to be typed literally into the system.
